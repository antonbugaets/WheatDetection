# WheatDetection
DL case 3  
# Introduction  
This programm system contains models which learned by 'TenserFlow'.  
The system allows you to test hypotheses on photos of wheat.  
For example, you can check the availability of harvest and evaluate the quality of work.  
# How to run  
conda create -n wheatenv python=3.6  
conda activate wheatenv  
pip3 install -r requirements.txt  
# Demo  
On img you could see prediction on wheat 'head'

# Metrics - Accuracy 
Accuracy result is 0.461, which means the model is 46.1% accurate in making a correct prediction.  
Accuracy is a metric that generally describes how the model performs across all classes. It is useful when all classes are of equal importance. It is calculated as the ratio between the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions.
